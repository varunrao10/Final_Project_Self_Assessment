# Final_Project_Self_Assessment

 ## Self-Assessment
 For my role I handled the database and architecture portion. I created the workflow that shows the pipleline process. After that I created the SQL scripts which got refined over time and initally used my AWS account. After manipulating the data and writing to the database using PySpark I found the free version of AWS was not good enough for the size of the data as it was taking more than 2 hours just to write. After that I switched to GCP because they gave a much better database for free which cut the time down to 15 minutes. Throughout this project I was brainstorming and sharing ideas with the team, My greatest challenge in this project was learning the ins and outs of pySpark. After spending time understanding the concepts and refererring to the  official documentation I felt much more comftorble with the technology.

 ## Team Assessment
 The team from the very start of the project always communicated with each other. We always met for every meeting and even made extra meetings. We used slack if we ever had any issues. The strenghts of our team include constant communication, independent and effecient work to minimize any team member from taking a bigger workload on the project than others. 

 ## Summary of Project
 Millions of people fly every day and delays are inevitable sometimes. So we looked into US domestic airflight data and created a machine model to predict delays. The machine model used is a Logistic regression model to predict whether a flight is delayed or not. After using multiple models the logistic regression model made the most sense for our data and gave us the highest accuracy at 88%.
